Description:
 
 This application allows a user to use the title and body text of a slides show as input for image search criteria. 
 The application does this by taking the title and the bold words used in the text of the slide and
 creates a website extension out of these words. This extension extends onto "http://www.searchscene.com/search?".
 searchscene.com was the search engine used because it was the first search engine that would give me image urls back.
 
 Once the "generate" button is clicked and the url extension is made the application then opens the image generation page
 and puts the image urls from the web page specified into a list (the list is only 21 images long because if I added more
 then the website would slow down significantly and this application was made to be as fast and helpful to the user as possible).
 
 The application then displays 3 images matching the users search criteria onto the screen. If the users wants to see more images then
 they can click on the "Next Images" button which will show the next images in the list. If a user wants to save an image then they
 can double click on the image they like then will be prompted to save the image or not.
 
Once the user has gone through all of the images in the list they will be notified and no more images will appear. Once the user is done
finding images they can then make a slide in their slide PowerPoint. The user can either create a new PowerPoint or add a slide to an
already existing one. Once the PowerPoint is made the application will display a pop up asking the user if they want to open the PowerPoint
Where they just added the slide.
